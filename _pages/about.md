        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I am Yicheng Qiao, born on November 30th, 2001, in Kaifeng City, China. Guided by the principles of love, peace, and the pursuit of truth, I have dedicated myself to research in computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am a joint program student at Tsinghua University and Beijing Sport University. I earned my degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology at Beijing Sport University and completed the joint educational program at Tsinghua University's School of Vehicle and Mobility.
        </p>
         <p>
          My academic journey has been deeply influenced by the remarkable work of leading researchers in deep learning. It inspired me to delve into this field myself. Under the guidance of patient professors, I have developed a solid understanding of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence since my sophomore year.

        <h2>Research Interest and Plan</h2>
        <p> 
          I'm planning to apply for a PhD program in the United States. If your lab has a suitable opportunity, please feel free to reach out. My ultimate goal is to develop safe and controllable strong AI that contributes to human civilization. 
        <ul> 
          <li><strong>On the one hand</strong>, I have a strong interest in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents, with a particular focus on their applications in multimodal learning, embodied intelligence, and 3D computer vision.
          </li> 
          <li><strong>On the other hand</strong>, I have extensive practical experience in autonomous driving and generative AI, and I aim to further advance application-driven research in these areas. My goal is to develop AI systems that are safer, more reliable, and capable of efficient deployment in real-world scenarios.
