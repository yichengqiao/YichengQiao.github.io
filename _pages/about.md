        <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>My story</h3>
         <p>
      I am Yicheng Qiao, born on November 30th, 2001, in Kaifeng City, China. As the Chinese proverb goes, *"The movement of heaven is full of power; thus the superior man makes himself strong and untiring."* This philosophy underpins my approach to life. 
      My passion for artificial intelligence began in middle school. Ever since AlphaGo defeated the world's strongest Go player, I have been determined to pursue a career in AI and aspired to study a related field at university.
     
        </p>
         <p>
      To achieve this, I have worked tirelessly over the years. In the college entrance examination, I ranked in the **top 2.5%** among over <strong> 1.158 million</strong> candidates in Henan Province and I'm <strong>139/150</strong> in math, top 3000. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I persevered and overcame numerous obstacles. <strong>Although my results fell slightly short of my expectations</strong>, I chose not to retake the exam. Instead, I embraced the opportunity to study computer science at a prestigious 211 university in Beijing.
      </p>
      <p>
      During my undergraduate studies, I maintained strong academic performance while actively participating in research projects, leading to notable achievements. My ultimate goal is to conduct meaningful and impactful research. I firmly believe that studying at the forefront of AI research is crucial to achieving this ambition. Therefore, I am determined to pursue a PhD in Computer Science in the US and advance toward the pinnacle of academic excellence.

        <h2>Research Interest and Plan</h2>
        <p> 
         I am a joint program student at Tsinghua University and Beijing Sport University. I earned my degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology at Beijing Sport University and completed the joint educational program at Tsinghua University's School of Vehicle and Mobility.
     
         <ul> 
          <li><strong>On the one hand</strong>, I have a strong interest in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents, with a particular focus on their applications in multimodal learning, embodied intelligence, and 3D computer vision.
          </li> 
          <li><strong>On the other hand</strong>, I have extensive practical experience in autonomous driving and generative AI, and I aim to further advance application-driven research in these areas. My goal is to develop AI systems that are safer, more reliable, and capable of efficient deployment in real-world scenarios.
